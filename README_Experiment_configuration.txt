******Experiment configuration parameters**********

- Trial: The trial name allows a scientist to identify the results associated with a specific trial.

- File name (JSON): File containing the visual items to be shown during an experiment trial.

- Item time: Exposure time in milliseconds of the visual items to the participant.

- Delay time: Delay time in milliseconds before the presentation of each visual item.

- Name and age: Experimentâ€™s participant name and age.

- Font size and color: In the case that the visual item to be shown is text, the font size (pt) and color (hexadecimal) can be defined.

- Background color: The screen background can be set up as static or dynamic. When static is selected, the picked color remains for a complete trial. It is also possible to either select bright or obscure options. In the case the first option is selected, the trial starts with the picked background color and lights gradually until white color is reached at the end of the trial. Similarly, if obscure is selected, the background color will obscure gradually to black.

- Gaze control padding: The padding of an invisible box around the displayed item for which the gaze point is still considered to be focused on the item.

- Gaze control time window: Specifies the maximum allowed time in milliseconds between leaving the invisible box and re-entering it before the presentation of items is paused.

- Show controls and save results: These options are intended for testing before a real experiment is conducted. The first option can be disabled to omit saving the experiment results, and the second option to show a set of buttons to manually control the displaying of the visual items.
